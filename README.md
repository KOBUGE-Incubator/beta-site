## Who we are

KOBUGE is short for "Kreative Organization of Buddies Using Godot Engine". We are a loose group of people, who make games with the Godot Engine. We love making games and we love open-source and libre software.

## Our Projects
In this section you can find a bunch of games that we are currently working on.

### Minilens
[Minilens](http://kobuge-games.github.io/minilens/ ) is a puzzle platformer.

Thousand years after humans went extinct, aliens send a robot series called Minilens to earth to clean up and retrieve surviving flora. They forget that Earth has gravity though, so Minilens can't jump.

### Game 2
Add some more interesting games. The minilens section can be used as an example for how this could look like.

### Other Games
There are also some other, small projects.
Big projects that are in development by a group of people from KOBUGE can be found at the [KOBUGE at github](https://github.com/kobuge-games).
Small projects in early development can be found at the [KOBUGE-Incubator at github](https://github.com/KOBUGE-Incubator)
